I am an AI-enthusiast, software engineer, husband, father, and technical leader. 

I worked at Amazon for 6 years on <span class="company">Alexa</span>. My last role was as the Director of Software Engineering for Proactive. I had the privilege of leading an amazing team improving customer experiences (like notifications, feedback, and contextual suggestions). We launched ML models at global scale for content ranking. Before that I managed software engineering teams to launch Alexa features such as: in-skill purchasing, voice skill enablement, quick links, the <a href="https://amazon.com/skills">Skills Store</a>, and many other systems. I have a few <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/mark-conrad-kockerbeck">patents</a> and published some Alexa <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=xeb.ai&i=alexa-skills&crid=24SC5YRHPNIXW&sprefix=xeb.a%2Calexa-skills%2C396&ref=nb_sb_noss">skills</a>.
        
I was also the Sr. Group Tech Manager at <span class="company">Blizzard Entertainment</span> for Engineering Systems. We built telemetry, automation, and cloud systems. I was the Technical Director for Platform Services and was grateful to be a part of some of Blizzard's most successful launches (e.g. Overwatch). 

I was originally born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada but moved to Arizona in my formidable years. I now live in Southern California (my personal Goldilocks zone of climate).

I am blessed to have an amazing family (immediate and extended). This blog be focused on my own personal work explorations and side-projects. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://github.com/xeb">GitHub profile</a> to see more or checkout my (sparse) <a href="/">posts</a>.

The ideas and work presented on this site are of my own creation, unrelated to past, present, or future employers.
