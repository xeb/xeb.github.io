My name is Mark Kockerbeck and I am a Software Engineering leader (usually a "Director") who wants to create global-scale, human-centric, valuable AI systems for millions of humans. This site is a collection of my own personal thoughts and experiments. Any association to current, past, or future employers is accidental and I try hard to keep my day job separate from my open source adventures.
